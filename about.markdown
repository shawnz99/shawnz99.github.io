I am a computer science graduate student at the University at Buffalo, State University of New York. I specialize on systems and networking. Currently I'm interested in applications of functional programming languages and techniques, operating systems, and distributed systems. I've worked professionally as a software engineer developing a modular hardware accelerated raytracing platform, drivers for 3D rendering and worked with the Research and development team to implement the results of their investigations into our pipeline.
